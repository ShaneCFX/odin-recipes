            <ul>
            <li>Ground Beef: Ground beef is the base for this recipe and we suggest using 85/15 (15% fat) ground beef. The fat gives flavor and keeps the meatloaf moist.</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs: Breadcrumbs soak up moisture from the ground beef, milk, and eggs as the meatloaf bakes, keeping the loaf super tender and moist.</li>
            <li>Onion: Onions add a wonderfully subtle savory flavor to the meatloaf.</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs: Breadcrumbs soak up moisture from the ground beef, milk, and eggs as the meatloaf bakes, keeping the loaf super tender and moist.</li>
            <li>Milk: Milk adds moisture and flavor to the meatloaf.</li>
            <li>Egg: Egg acts as a binder for the meatloaf so it doesn’t fall apart when sliced, plus it adds flavor, moisture, and richness.</li>
            <li>Seasoning: This meatloaf is seasoned simply with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. It’s just enough seasoning to add flavor without overpowering the natural beef flavor.</li>
            <li>Worcestershire Sauce: Worcestershire sauce is used in both the meatloaf and the glaze. It offers a deliciously savory umami flavor with just a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Ketchup: Ketchup is the base for the sweet and tangy glaze that goes on top of the meatloaf.</li>
            <li>Brown Sugar: Brown sugar helps balance the ketchup’s acidity and gives the glaze its beautifully glossy finish.</li>
            <li>Yellow Mustard: Mustard adds depth and savory flavor to the glaze.</li>

            <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF.<br> By pre-mixing some of the ingredients for the meatloaf so there will be less mixing required for the meat (overmixing the meat can make meatloaf tough).
                    in a small bowl, <br>whisk together ⅓ cup milk, one large egg, and 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce.<br> a separate bowl, stir together ½ cup breadcrumbs, ½ teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, ¼ tsp freshly cracked pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>
                    Mince about a ½ cup onion. Make sure to chop or mince the onion as finely as possible. Chunky onion can make the meatloaf fall apart more easily. 
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Add the milk mixture, breadcrumb mixture, and minced onion to 1.5 lbs. ground beef (85/15). 
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Mix with your hands until everything is evenly combined. Avoid overmixing.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Place the meatloaf mixture on a rimmed baking sheet or baking dish and shape it into a loaf that is approximately 8″ long, 4″ wide, and 2″ tall. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Next, combine the ingredients for the glaze. Stir together ½ cup ketchup, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 teaspoon yellow mustard, and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Spread the glaze over the top and sides of the meatloaf.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Bake the meatloaf in the preheated 350ºF oven for 50-55 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. <br>Let the meatloaf rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
                </li>
