            <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning </li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt </li>
            <li>1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
            <li>1.5 lbs. ground beef (85/15) </li>

            </ul>

            <h6>Glaze</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp yellow mustard</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF.<br> By pre-mixing some of the ingredients for the meatloaf so there will be less mixing required for the meat (overmixing the meat can make meatloaf tough).
                    in a small bowl, <br>whisk together ⅓ cup milk, one large egg, and 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce.<br> a separate bowl, stir together ½ cup breadcrumbs, ½ teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, ¼ tsp freshly cracked pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>
                    Mince about a ½ cup onion. Make sure to chop or mince the onion as finely as possible. Chunky onion can make the meatloaf fall apart more easily. 
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Add the milk mixture, breadcrumb mixture, and minced onion to 1.5 lbs. ground beef (85/15). 
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Mix with your hands until everything is evenly combined. Avoid overmixing.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Place the meatloaf mixture on a rimmed baking sheet or baking dish and shape it into a loaf that is approximately 8″ long, 4″ wide, and 2″ tall. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Next, combine the ingredients for the glaze. Stir together ½ cup ketchup, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 teaspoon yellow mustard, and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Spread the glaze over the top and sides of the meatloaf.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Bake the meatloaf in the preheated 350ºF oven for 50-55 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. <br>Let the meatloaf rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
                </li>
