            <ul>
                <li> 3 lbs boneless and skinless chicken thighs, about 5 to 6</li>
                <li> 2 tsp adobo</li>
                <li> 1 1/2 tsp sazón</li>
                <li> 2 tsp salt</li>
                <li> 2 Tbsp cooking oil, plus a touch more for greasing</li>
                <li> 1 cup BBQ Sauce</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Steps</h1>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel. Then chop the chicken into bite-size pieces (about 5 to 6 pieces per thigh).</li>
                <li>Add the adobo, sazón, and salt to a large bowl and mix.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped chicken thighs to the bowl along with the cooking oil and mix until the chicken is thoroughly covered. <br> with plastic wrap or parchment directly on the surface of the chicken and marinate for at least an hour, but preferably overnight.</li>
                <li>Half an hour before you pull the chicken, soak at least 6 wood skewers in water so they don't burn. It's best to soak a few extra skewers just in case one of them breaks.</li>
                <li>When you're ready to cook, preheat a grill pan on high. Then thread a thigh's worth of chicken pieces on each skewer, about 5 or 6 chunks. <br>You want the chicken chunks close but not pressed tightly against each other. Brush both sides of each skewer with BBQ sauce, about 1/2 cup total.</li>
                <li>When the grill pan is smoking hot, brush it with a touch of cooking oil. Then, place the skewers on the grill pan, making sure not to crowd the pan or place the skewers too close to each other.</li>
                <li>After 5 minutes, brush 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce on the top surface of the chicken. Next, flip the chicken, and brush another 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce on the top layer. <br>Cook for 5 more minutes, until char develops and the internal temperature of the chicken registers at 160°F. Now all you have left to do is eat! Buen provecho!</li>
            </ol>
